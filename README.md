== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS). We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission. We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
